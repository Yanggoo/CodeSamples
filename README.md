# README

Hello! My name is Xiaodong Yang. This is my portfolio, and you can also check out my website: https://yanggoo.github.io/ which performs detailed videos.

This directory contains four code examples from projects—Canopy Quest and PDE-based Point Cloud Compression. Each folder includes two code samples and documentations for them.

Below are brief descriptions of these two projects:

## Canopy Quest （Oct 2023 - Nov 2023）

- Personal project of mine to explore a roguelike dungeon game.
- Engineered a dynamic terrain system for Canopy Quest, generating ladders, platforms, traps, chests, monsters, and items with random seeds.
- Created AI for multiple monsters as well as weapons and ensured the seamless recreation of the game world.

## PDE-based point cloud compression framework （Mar 2022 - Aug 2022）

- Academic project of mine focus on point cloud compression.
- Strengthened and executed an attribute prediction framework on the TMC13 platform by 12.00%.
- Enhanced algorithm performance by streamlining theoretical models, resulting in improved encoding speed.
